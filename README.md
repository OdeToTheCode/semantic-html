# Semantic HTML Homework

## What was the purpose of this project?

The Goal of this assignment is clean up both the html and the css code. When cleaning up the html file, we needed to add semantic coding in place of some of the generic <'div'> elements.

When cleaning up the CSS file, we needed to change some of the corrisponding elments changed in the html file. We also consolidated some of the css code so that the file was smaller and more legable.

In both the CSS file and the html file we corrected some typos in the coding itself. The typos didn't effect the functionality of the website but it is now easier to read and understand.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
